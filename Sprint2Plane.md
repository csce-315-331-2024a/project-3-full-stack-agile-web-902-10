 Our goal this sprint is to make a full MVP that allows users to place order, managers to change the menu, employees to be edited, etc. In short, the goal is to make our web app edit and update the database based on user inputs. Accessbility features and customizing menu item ingredients for the customer is not a part of this sprint goal.
